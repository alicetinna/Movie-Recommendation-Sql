# Movie-Recommendation-Sql

In daily life, when we have a lot of choices, we get confused all the time. Taking an example, what to watch next? It will be easy if someone could recommend the movies of the similar genre we like based on the high ratings provided by other users.
This is what we are trying to build a Recommendation system. Our database keeps information for Movies, TV shows, crew, Ratings, Users, and subscriptions. 
Each movie or TV show has a title, a genre, the release date, stars, and an average rating. A TV show may also have multiple seasons. 
The database collects detailed information about actors, including their names, sex, birth year, and awards. The system will also keep track of customers’ watching histories for further analyses. It records each customer’s personal information, such as name, sex, birth year, zip code, and occupation. 

Created a project based on MOVIE data from Kaggle.Used SQL, python and Nosql to complete the project.
Connected MySql database in the pycharm IDE, using SQl connector and performed various queries and visualization using python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
Adding video presentation while performing various visualization.
